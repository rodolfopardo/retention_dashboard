KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

   - Tier 5 (SMB) accounts have 36.8% churn rate - nearly 5x higher than
     Tier 1 Enterprise accounts (7.5%)

   - Former clients had average ARR of $41,000 compared to $101,000 for
     active clients - a 60% difference

   - Engagement metrics show churned customers had significantly lower
     product usage across all categories

   - NPS scores are similar between active (29.1) and former clients (27.8),
     suggesting NPS alone is not a strong churn predictor
